# Hello Plugin

This plugin is a template that shows the use of the plugin system to
create a new API.

### `hello_plugin`

These files deal with the plugin system of graphene. They allow for
configuration using program parameters and deal with the startup and
shutdown of the application.

### `hello_api`

These files provide the actual API that can be later used to add
additional API calls that are reflected into the RPC subsystem of
graphene.
